# Firebase Setup Guide

> **Disclaimer:** This guide is provided to help configure the plugin. We are not responsible for any data loss, security issues, or charges incurred through Firebase usage. Use Firebase at your own risk.

This guide explains how to create a Firebase Realtime Database that your group can use with the plugin.
## Step 1: Open the Firebase Console  
Go to [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.  
If you do not have a Google account, you can create one for free.

## Step 2: Create a New Project  
Once you are logged in, click **“Create a new project.”**  
Give your project a name that others **will not easily guess**. This name will be part of the project’s URL and helps protect your group’s data.

### Our recommendation
Use a random sequence of letters and numbers for the project name — [generate one here](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=1&len=30&digits=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=plain&rnd=new)

## Step 3: Access the Realtime Database  
After the project is created, look for **“Build” → “Realtime Database”** in the menu on the left, and click it.  
Then, click **“Create Database.”**

## Step 4: Choose a Region  
Select the region closest to you or your group members.  
A nearby region makes the database respond faster. Click **“Next.”**

## Step 5: Enable the Database  
When asked about security mode, click **“Enable.”**  
The initial security mode does not matter because you will replace the rules in the next step.

## Step 6: Update the Rules  
In the Realtime Database view, switch to the **Rules** tab.  
You will see some text that defines who can read and write data.  
Delete everything in that box and replace it with this:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```

Then click **“Publish.”**

## Step 7: Optional - Disable insecure rules alerts
Because these rules allow anyone with the database URL to read and write data, Firebase may warn you that your Realtime Database has insecure rules. This open-rule configuration is a temporary workaround. Access is kept private by using a hard-to-guess project name and only sharing the database URL with trusted people.

If you do not want repeated warnings, open **Project Overview** in the top-left corner of the Firebase console and click **Alerts** in the popover. Scroll down to **Realtime Database** (not **Cloud Firestore**) and find **Your Realtime Database has insecure rules**. Disable it for **In Firebase console** if you want, and especially for **Email** if you want to avoid daily warning emails.

## Step 8: Copy the Database URL  
Once the rules are published, return to the **Data** tab. At the top, you will see your database’s reference URL — it looks something like this:

```
https://your-project-name-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/
```

Copy this URL using the link button on the left.
You’re done! Your Firebase database is now ready to connect to the plugin.

## Step 9: Connect the Plugin to Firebase
Paste your database URL into the plugin to set up your account.  
The first person to connect using the URL becomes the **group owner**.

You can share the URL with other trusted members so they can join your group.  
**Important:** Anyone with this URL can view and modify your database, so share it only with people you trust.
